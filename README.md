# Create an Organization
Design an organization and document it (using simple html) so that your
Investors (Angel Investors - for profit startup, Bosses - an established
business unit, Donors - non-profit) can approve the projects and fund them.

## Technologies / Topics to Learn

These basic work flow and information sharing skills are critical for all your projects in this class (and in general it is important to know how to share work and to keep old versions)

* **HTML** basics - (headers, lists, links, images, text and paragraphs)
* **Git** workflow - branches (master and development branches), the ability
to roll back as needed, and shared work (submitting & reviewing -- pull requests)

## Design

#### Task Overview

Design an organization with a mission (non-profit or for profit) - all your
projects will be reviewed within the context of your chosen mission and
approved when they align.

#### Empathathy

* Think about this organization from the perspective of your Donors (teachers)
* Think about this organization from the perspective of your interests as an organization founder

#### Define

* Choose an organization name
* Create an organization mission - _Why does your organization design technology products?_
* Create an organization logo

#### Ideate

* Create 3 names and 3 logs
* Choose 3 available projects that are interesting to you
* Discuss within your team at least 3 different projects and how they fit within the context of your organization

#### Prototype

* Sketch 3 versions of your organization's website include: (Name, logo, mission and one project) -- **Take photos and print copies** (you can both scan and copy your sketches with the photocopier / printer)
* Show your sketches to another group of students and explain how the project on each page relates to your mission
* Find our what part of each sketch is best liked by the other group - write notes on what they liked best

#### Test

* Adjust your design (take the best parts of each design)
* Create this web page using the provided template
* Show your Investors (teachers) this website when you are ready
* Make adjustments as needed
* Go live with your website when approved by investors
